     A HTML5 breakout game in JavaScript.

This is a simple version, more will be added :)

Todo:
- Change ball direction angle when hitting the bar on the edge or at speed.
- The speed of the game loop is to slow
- An XorPut of that ball would be faster then the clear I use now (if canvas can do that)
